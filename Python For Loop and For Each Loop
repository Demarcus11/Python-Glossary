#  Python for loop has a range() function that takes 3 parameters: for i in range(start index(inclusive), stop index(exclusive, so wont include this value), step size(increment))


# Example of a for loop that loops through nums array printing every number 
nums [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in range(len(nums)):
    print(nums[i])
 Output = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  
  
 # Example of a for loop that starts at index 1 and takes the running sum of nums array
 nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 for i in range(1, len(nums)):
     nums[i] += nums[i - 1]
 Output = [1, 3, 6, 10]
  
  
 # Example of a for loop that increments by 2
 for i in range(0, 10, 2):
     print(i)
 Output = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
 
 
 # Example of a for loop loop that increments backwards in increments of 2
 for i in range(10, 0, -2):
     print(i)
  Output = 10, 8, 6, 4, 2
   
   
# Example of a for each loop that loops through nums array printing every number
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in nums:
    print(number)
Output = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
